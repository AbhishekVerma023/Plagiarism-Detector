# Plagiarism-Detector
Implementation of KMP algorithm for plagiarism detection

## About the Detector

### Input -
1. The file to be compared with <br>
2. The file to be compared<br>
        
### Expected Output - 
The output window will show the matching percentage of both the files. If the match is more than a certain threshold (default value 60%), an additional line will get printed to the console - "The input file appears to be plagiarised. x% of its content matches with the file F." (F - name of the file with matching percentage >= threshold, x - the matching percentage.)
